# **App Name**: PathWise AI

## Core Features:

- AI Roadmap Generation: Generate personalized learning roadmaps with modular structure (Topic -> Modules -> Units -> Checkpoints -> Resources -> Projects) based on user's goals, current knowledge, time availability, and preferred learning style using an AI tool.
- Dynamic Progress Tracking: Allow users to mark lessons as complete and visualize their progress along the roadmap in an interactive dashboard with a skill-tree-like visual.
- Learning Style Adaptation: Enable users to switch between learning modes (video-first, hands-on coding, theory, project-based) and adapt the roadmap based on their preferences.
- Skill Level Assessment: Implement a system for optional skill level assessment through quizzes, mini-projects, or code scanning to tailor the roadmap to the user's existing knowledge.
- Smart Resource Aggregation: Aggregate resources from platforms like YouTube, blog posts, and GitHub based on quality and relevance, providing AI-generated summaries and context for each resource using an AI tool.
- Project-Driven Learning: Offer real-world project ideas tied to roadmap milestones, auto-generated with AI assistance, to provide practical experience.
- AI Assistant/Tutor: Provide an AI assistant/tutor that can answer questions, explain concepts, and provide code generation and debugging support using RAG to fetch information.
- Profile Page: Allow users to manage their profile including basic info, learning roadmaps, completed modules, projects, and settings

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep, saturated blue (#3F51B5) to evoke trust, intelligence, and progress.
- Background color: A very light gray-blue (#F0F4F8), desaturated to provide a calm, clean backdrop.
- Accent color: A vibrant, contrasting purple (#7E57C2), for highlighting key actions and elements, like completing steps on the learning roadmap.
- Secondary accent color: A vibrant orange (#FF9800), for highlighting interactive elements and calls to action.
- Tertiary accent color: A bright cyan (#00BCD4), for progress indicators and visual feedback.
- Body text and headlines: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, should be used to give a modern, machined, objective feel to the app.
- Use clean, minimalist icons to represent different learning resources and actions.
- A clear, step-by-step layout for the roadmap, with intuitive navigation and progress indicators, presented as a skill tree.
- Subtle animations to highlight progress and provide feedback on user interactions.
